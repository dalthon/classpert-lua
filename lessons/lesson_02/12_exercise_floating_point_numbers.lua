-- Instructions

-- a) Change the definition of numeral so that it can match floating-point
--    numbers like `0.1` and `13.25`. It is up to you whether the syntax would
--    also accept things like `0.` or `.5`.
--    (You probably won't need to change anything in the captures for this
--    feature as all operations we used naturally handle floats)

-- b) Add scientific notation ("E notation") to the previous definition, so
--    that we can write numbers like `0.5E-3` and `123e12`.
--    (Again, you probably won't need to change anything in the captures)
