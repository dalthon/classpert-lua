-- Instructions

-- Change the program to also accept hexadecimal numbers, in the format usually
-- used by other programming languages. Make sure to accept both upper and
-- lower-case letters, both for the initial "X" and for the hex digits.
-- (Once you match the numeral, you can use the Lua function `tonumber`
-- directly on it.)
