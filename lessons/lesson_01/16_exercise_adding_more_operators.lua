-- Instructions

-- a) Add a remainder operator ('%') to the language, with the same priority as
--    the other multiplicative operators.

-- b) Add an exponential operator ('^') to the language, with a higher priority
--    than the multiplicative operators. Use the same concepts we used when we
--    added multiplicative operators. You will probably need a new kind of
--    expression, besides 'term' and 'exp'.
